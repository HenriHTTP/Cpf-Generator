This algorithm uses the default_rng function from the NumPy library to generate valid CPF numbers. CPF stands for Cadastro de Pessoas FÃ­sicas, which is a Brazilian document used to identify individuals and register them in the Brazilian Taxpayer Registry.

The algorithm works by generating nine random numbers between 0 and 9, and then using the CPF algorithm to calculate two additional digits. The CPF algorithm is based on a modulo 11 check, which is a mathematical operation that verifies if a number is divisible by 11.

First, the algorithm generates the nine random numbers and stores them in an array. Then, it calculates the first digit by multiplying each of the nine numbers by a factor (from 10 to 2) and adding the results. After that, it calculates the second digit by multiplying the first digit by a factor (from 11 to 2) and adding the results. Finally, the algorithm concatenates the nine random numbers with the two calculated digits, and returns the resulting CPF number.

This algorithm is a simple and efficient way to generate valid CPF numbers in Python. It is also very useful for testing applications that require CPF numbers as input.
